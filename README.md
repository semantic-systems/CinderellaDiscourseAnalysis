# CinderellaDiscourseAnalysis
a prototype for discourse analysis on 500 versions of cinderella 

# resources
1. Gutenberg Project
2. pretrained framenet transformer https://github.com/chanind/frame-semantic-transformer 

# Idea
As a fast proof-of-concept, the goal here is to see how different versions of Cinderella differ from each other on a discourse level (how a story is told), where stories (or events) are represented as frames. Generative models will be used. 

If meaningful findings are discovered, then it makes sense to go beyond FrameNet -> proper event extraction
